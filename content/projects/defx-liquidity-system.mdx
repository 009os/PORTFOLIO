**Defx Liquidity System** is a proprietary high-frequency trading platform designed to provide automated liquidity on the Defx exchange. This company-specific system was built to execute ultra-fast trades with sub-millisecond precision, optimizing market making strategies and capturing arbitrage opportunities in real-time.

Built entirely in **NestJS**, the system leverages **WebSocket connections** for real-time market data feeds and order execution, ensuring minimal latency for high-frequency operations. The platform integrates seamlessly with Defx's trading APIs to provide continuous liquidity across multiple trading pairs.

The system employs advanced **market making algorithms** that dynamically adjust bid-ask spreads based on market volatility, order book depth, and real-time price movements. It uses **Redis** for ultra-fast in-memory caching of market data, order states, and position tracking, enabling microsecond-level decision making.

**Prisma ORM** handles all database operations with high-performance queries for trade history, position management, and risk calculations. The system maintains comprehensive audit trails and compliance records while executing thousands of trades per second.

The platform features sophisticated risk management including **real-time position monitoring**, **automated stop-loss mechanisms**, and **dynamic capital allocation** across multiple trading strategies. Advanced monitoring dashboards provide real-time insights into liquidity provision metrics, P&L tracking, and system performance.

As a private, company-specific solution, this system demonstrates expertise in building institutional-grade trading infrastructure with enterprise-level reliability, security, and performance optimization for cryptocurrency market making operations.
