**_Funding Fee Arbitrage_** is a production-grade trading system designed to automate delta-neutral strategies and consistently capture positive funding rates across major crypto exchanges like **_Binance_**, **_Bybit_**, and **_OKX_**. The system actively monitors funding rates, places offsetting positions, and dynamically manages trades based on user-defined configurations.

It features a modular backend built with **_NestJS_**, using **_Prisma ORM_** for database interactions and **_Redis_** for fast, in-memory data caching and queue management. The system integrates both **_REST_** and **_WebSocket APIs_** for live order execution, position tracking, and robust error handling.

**_This was developed as part of a proprietary company project. While the full system remains private, selected backend modules have been made publicly available to showcase the architecture and implementation approach._**
