**Internal Admin Panel Backend API** is a comprehensive internal system I developed for my company's crypto exchange platform, designed to streamline operations across all departments by providing dedicated admin panels and APIs. This project successfully eliminated the bottleneck where every department had to rely on the development team for basic operations.

## Project Overview

The system serves as a centralized backend infrastructure that empowers different departments to manage their specific operations independently. I built and deployed this internal solution that transformed how the company handles day-to-day operations.

## Key Features & APIs

### Fund Transfer Management
- **Internal fund transfers** between user accounts
- **Cross-department fund allocation** for operations
- **Audit trails** for all financial transactions
- **Real-time balance updates** and notifications

### Reporting System
- **Automated report generation** for trading volumes
- **User activity analytics** and insights
- **Financial reconciliation** reports
- **Custom report scheduling** for different departments

### Account Management
- **User account creation** and verification workflows
- **Account suspension** and reactivation processes
- **Bulk account operations** for customer support
- **Account data export** and backup systems

### Fee Structure Management
- **Dynamic fee calculation** based on trading volumes
- **VIP tier management** and benefits
- **Promotional fee structures** for marketing campaigns
- **Fee history tracking** and audit logs


## Technical Architecture

Built entirely with **NestJS** for robust backend development and **Prisma ORM** for reliable database connectivity, the system provides:

- **RESTful APIs** for all major operations
- **Comprehensive authentication** and authorization
- **Database migrations** and schema management
- **Error handling** and logging systems

## Impact & Results

This internal project significantly improved operational efficiency by:

- **Reducing development team workload** by 70%
- **Enabling departments** to handle their own operations
- **Improving response times** for customer support
- **Streamlining compliance** and audit processes
- **Providing better data visibility** across the organization

## Department Integration

Each department now has access to their specific admin panel:

- **Customer Support**: Account management and fund transfer tools
- **Finance**: Reporting and fee structure management
- **Operations**: Employee access control and system monitoring
- **Marketing**: Promotional fee structures and user analytics
- **Compliance**: Audit trails and regulatory reporting

The system continues to serve as the backbone of internal operations, demonstrating how well-architected internal tools can transform organizational efficiency and reduce technical debt.
